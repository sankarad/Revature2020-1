 * 1. Return the nth Fibonacci number
 * Test Cases:
 * Input: 0     Output: 0
 * Input: 1    Output: 1
 * Input: 2     Output: 1
 * Input: 10    Output: 55

 * 2. Sort an array of integers.
 * Test Cases:
 * Input: [2,4,5,1,3,1]     Output: [1,1,2,3,4,5]
 * Input: [5,4,3,2,1]     Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
 *
 * Don't use the sort() method... that would be lame.

 * 4. Rotate left
 * Given an array, array, and an integer, n, rotate the values in array left n times and return array
 * Test Cases:
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], 1    Output: [2,3,4,5,1]
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], 6    Output: [2,3,4,5,1]

 * 5. Balanced Brackets
 * A bracket is any one of the following: (, ), {, }, [, or ]
 * 
 * The following are balanced brackets:
 *    ( )
 *    ( ) ( )
 *    ( ( ) )
 *    ( { [ ] } )

 * The following are NOT balanced brackets:
 *   (

 *   ( ( )
 *   ( [ ) ]
 *
 * Return true if balanced
 * Return false if not balanced

 * 6. Create a method that retrieves a list of all accounts and updates those accounts.
 *      Create a custom field on the Account standard object called Size__c that will be a 
 * picklist containing small/medium/large.
 *     Create a method that retrieves a list of all accounts. 
 *         - If an account has between 1-1000 employees then it is classified as small.
 *         - If an account has between 1001-10000 employees it is classified as medium.
*         - If an account has more than 10000 employees it is classified as large.

 * Converted' and their description should display the message, "We are no longer doing 
 * business in California."
